    """Convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token occurrences

    A parallel version of ``sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer``

    Parameters
    ----------
    input : string {'filename', 'file', 'content'}
        If 'filename', the sequence passed as an argument to fit is
        expected to be a list of filenames that need reading to fetch
        the raw content to analyze.
        If 'file', the sequence items must have a 'read' method (file-like
        object) that is called to fetch the bytes in memory.
        Otherwise the input is expected to be the sequence strings or
        bytes items are expected to be analyzed directly.
    encoding : string, default='utf-8'
        If bytes or files are given to analyze, this encoding is used to
        decode.
    decode_error : {'strict', 'ignore', 'replace'}
        Instruction on what to do if a byte sequence is given to analyze that
        contains characters not of the given `encoding`. By default, it is
        'strict', meaning that a UnicodeDecodeError will be raised. Other
        values are 'ignore' and 'replace'.
    strip_accents : {'ascii', 'unicode', None}
        Remove accents during the preprocessing step.
        'ascii' is a fast method that only works on characters that have
        an direct ASCII mapping.
        'unicode' is a slightly slower method that works on any characters.
        None (default) does nothing.
    analyzer : string, {'word', 'char', 'char_wb'} or callable
        Whether the feature should be made of word or character n-grams.
        Option 'char_wb' creates character n-grams only from text inside
        word boundaries; n-grams at the edges of words are padded with space.
        If a callable is passed it is used to extract the sequence of features
        out of the raw, unprocessed input.
    preprocessor : callable or None (default)
        Override the preprocessing (string transformation) stage while
        preserving the tokenizing and n-grams generation steps.
    tokenizer : callable or None (default)
        Override the string tokenization step while preserving the
        preprocessing and n-grams generation steps.
        Only applies if ``analyzer == 'word'``.
    ngram_range : tuple (min_n, max_n), default=(1, 1)
        The lower and upper boundary of the range of n-values for different
        n-grams to be extracted. All values of n such that min_n <= n <= max_n
        will be used.
    stop_words : string {'english'}, list, or None (default)
        If 'english', a built-in stop word list for English is used.
        If a list, that list is assumed to contain stop words, all of which
        will be removed from the resulting tokens.
        Only applies if ``analyzer == 'word'``.
    lowercase : boolean, default=True
        Convert all characters to lowercase before tokenizing.
    token_pattern : string
        Regular expression denoting what constitutes a "token", only used
        if ``analyzer == 'word'``. The default regexp selects tokens of 2
        or more alphanumeric characters (punctuation is completely ignored
        and always treated as a token separator).
    n_features : integer, default=(2 ** 20)
        The number of features (columns) in the output matrices. Small numbers
        of features are likely to cause hash collisions, but large numbers
        will cause larger coefficient dimensions in linear learners.
    norm : 'l1', 'l2' or None, optional
        Norm used to normalize term vectors. None for no normalization.
    binary : boolean, default=False.
        If True, all non zero counts are set to 1. This is useful for discrete
        probabilistic models that model binary events rather than integer
        counts.
    dtype : type, optional
        Type of the matrix returned by fit_transform() or transform().
    alternate_sign : boolean, optional, default True
        When True, an alternating sign is added to the features as to
        approximately conserve the inner product in the hashed space even for
        small n_features. This approach is similar to sparse random projection.
